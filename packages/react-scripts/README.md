# mobility-react-scripts
This is a fork of [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts) for [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Custom path to serve app
Custom path so src does not have to be at root. You can choose where you want to serve it up with an env variable:
```
CLIENT_DIRECTORY='client/'
```
This would allow everything for the create-react-app to live inside a `client` directory.

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
Please refer to its documentation:
